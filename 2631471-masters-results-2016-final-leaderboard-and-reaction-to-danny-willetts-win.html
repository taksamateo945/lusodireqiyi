This came on the heels of bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes.</p><p>The No. 12 disaster sunk his tournament score from five under to one under, and he would go on to finish with a final-round score of 73.</p><p>His inconceivable meltdown paved the way for England's Danny Willett to win the 2016 Masters, the first major win of his career and his first PGA Tour win of any kind since turning pro in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here's the final leaderboard from the competition:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Willett shot a 67 on Sunday with five birdies and no bogeys. Three of those birdies came on the final six holes. It was the only round of the tournament in which he didn't shoot above par. The Englishman needed every bit of that unblemished round, as he beat Spieth by only three strokes.</span></p><p><span>Willett said he was happy to be in a position to win when it all went belly up for Spieth, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN.com's Jason Sobel</a>:</span></p><p><span><span>I just feel fortunate that I was in the position that I was to pounce on the opportunity to accomplish it. If I had been 5 over par, then it wouldn't have mattered what Jordan had done. Fortunately I was in a position where we were in second place, playing quite nicely, and as a result of him doing what he did, we were able to stay at the lead.</span><br></span></p><p>His recent play on the PGA Tour didn't do a whole lot to suggest he would emerge as Masters champion. The 28-year-old did manage a third-place finish at the World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championship on March 3 but finished tied for 22nd at the Valspar Championship and tied for 28th at the WGC-Dell Match Play tourney to close out the month.</p><p>Willett's first three rounds were steady if unspectacular, as he notched a 70 in the first round, 74 in the second and 72 on Saturday. There were certainly bright spots throughout, and the PGA Tour recapped his play over four rounds in Augusta, Georgia:&nbsp;</p>PGA TOUR <span class=acct>@PGATOUR</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear golf fans, Here's how to win the Masters. Signed, Danny Willett https://t.co/dIatOZpLsU</p><p>Jim Rome reminded folks to give Willett credit where it was due: &nbsp;</p>Jim Rome <span class=acct>@jimrome</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don't get it twisted - Danny Willett didn't back into this. 5-under on Sunday at Augusta is no joke.</p><p>While Willett was busy working his way toward a green jacket, his brother, PJ, was hard at work <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stealing the show</a> on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how he reacted to his sibling's big win:&nbsp;</p>P J Willett <span class=acct>@P_J_Willett</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Speechless. I once punched that kid in the head for hurting my pet rat. Now look. #bbcgolf #TheMasters</p><p>Willett's win was made all the more special by the fact that he nearly didn't play the tournament.</p><p>ESPN's Darren Rovell shared the happy reason why:&nbsp;</p>Darren Rovell <span class=acct>@darrenrovell</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The wife of Danny Willett, who is in second place, was supposed to have a baby today. Had it last week, which is why he's here.</p><p>Spieth was gracious in defeat and explained his unraveling on No. 12.&nbsp;</p><p>"I didn’t take that extra deep breath and really focus on my line," he said of his first tee shot, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">' Karen Crouse</a>. "Instead, I went up and I just put a quick swing on it."</p><p><span>Soon after Spieth's epic collapse, the Toronto Star's Bruce Arthur&nbsp;tried to head off the Internet meme du jour:<br></span></p>Bruce Arthur <span class=acct>@bruce_arthur</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>If any of you tweet about Crying Jordan Spieth I swear to god</p><p><span>His calls went <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unheeded</a>, and&nbsp;<span>Jimmy Donofrio provided the best of the bunch:</span><br></span></p>Jimmy Donofrio <span class=acct>@JimmyDonofrio</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>12th Hole at Augusta is pretty tough, just look at the overhead #TheMasters https://t.co/abqh8co3xj</p><p><span>HBO's Bill Simmons tried to put things in perspective:&nbsp;</span></p>Bill Simmons <span class=acct>@BillSimmons</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Keep your head up Jordan Spieth. You just finished 2-1-2 in the past 3 Masters and you're 22 years old.</p><p>Crouse noted that&nbsp;Spieth's fall and Willett's rise resembled the finish of the 1996 Masters:</p><p><span>The scene on the back nine on a cool afternoon called to mind Greg Norman’s six-stroke collapse in this event in 1996, which handed the tournament to the Englishman Nick Faldo. Spieth bounced back with birdies on two of the next three holes but had too much ground to make up and not enough holes. He finished with a second consecutive 73, which was three strokes higher than his closing score last year, when he matched the 72-hole score of 18 under set by Woods in 1997.</span></p><p><span>Sunday's events are going to haunt Spieth, but he's young and talented and should have little trouble recovering from his nightmare play.</span></p><p>Willett has, of course, gained plenty of fame moving forward, but it's a tad unfortunate that the first thing people are likely to think of when they recall the 2016 Masters will be another player's folly and not Willett's deserving win. It hopefully won't bother Willett. After all, he has the green jacket.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9rYWmEcnnMmqqtnaKoerOx0q6jratdZ31ygoyfoKeZnGK5pq3Dnqmbp5GnsW6tzZ1kq52RmMGqu81mq6hllJa7r8WMsKClpJWpwbR51qKl</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2631471-masters-results-2016-final-leaderboard-and-reaction-to-danny-willetts-win.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2631471-masters-results-2016-final-leaderboard-and-reaction-to-danny-willetts-win.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2631471-masters-results-2016-final-leaderboard-and-reaction-to-danny-willetts-win.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2631471-masters-results-2016-final-leaderboard-and-reaction-to-danny-willetts-win.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2631471-masters-results-2016-final-leaderboard-and-reaction-to-danny-willetts-win.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2631471-masters-results-2016-final-leaderboard-and-reaction-to-danny-willetts-win.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-jordan-parents.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-jordan-parents.html>Michael Jordan Parents: Everything You Need to Know About the NBA Legends Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nene-leakes-shares-a-casa-leakes-tour-welcome-to-her-famous-closet-398997.html>NeNe Leakes Shares A Casa Leakes Tour Welcome To Her Famous Closet!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nene-leakes-shares-a-casa-leakes-tour-welcome-to-her-famous-closet-398997.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

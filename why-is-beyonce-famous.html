Her solo success is unrivaled and she’s released six studio albums. In addition to achieving immense fame in her own right, she’s married to rapper Jay-Z.</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about why Beyoncé is so famous and the career milestones that have brought her to where she is today.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Destiny’s Child</h2><p>Beyoncé’s first taste of success came when she was still a child when she was placed in a girl group called ‘Girl’s Tyme’ with Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Roberson. The group would morph into Destiny’s Child in 1996 when they received a record deal.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Described</a> as a “hyper stylized mix of old-school girl group and newfangled fem-pop”, Destiny’s Child was incredibly successful.</p><p>Beyoncé was just <a href=# rel=noopener>15</a> when their first single was released and the band’s primary goal at that time was to sell records. It wasn’t long before they were selling millions, and their second album ‘The Writing’s on the Wall’ went multi-platinum and earned them <a href=# rel=noopener>Grammy Awards</a>.</p><p>The group was together from 1997 until 2002, although during this time some of the members left and were replaced. The band eventually decided to take a break to pursue solo careers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Solo Career</h2><p>Beyoncé’s solo career started with a bang, helped by the fame she had already received from Destiny’s Child.</p><p>Her first solo debut album ‘Dangerously in Love’ sold <a href=# rel=noopener>317,000 copies</a> in its first week and its single ‘Crazy in Love’ was her first number one solo single in the US, setting a precedent for things to come.</p><p>As a solo artist, Beyoncé has released 6 studio albums, all of which have been certified Platinum by the <a href=# rel=noopener>RIAA</a>.</p><p>Speaking of how her approach to music has changed since achieving her first taste of success with Destiny’s Child, the singer <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> “now I want to create something that I’ll be proud of 20, 30, 40 years from now – something that will last beyond me”.</p><p>Though she’s known primarily for her musical career, Beyoncé has also appeared in multiple <a href=# rel=noopener>movies</a>, only adding to her broad popularity and appeal.</p><p>She played the voice of Nala in the Disney remake of ‘The Lion King’ and played the role of Deena Jones in the 2006 film ‘Dreamgirls’.&nbsp;</p><p>She’s also directed ‘Black is King’ for Disney+ as well as her concert film <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Homecoming’</a>, about her performance at Coachella in 2018.</p><p>Listen to Beyoncé’s single ‘Crazy in Love’ from her debut album in the YouTube video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Famous Family</h2><p>Though Beyoncé was a star long before she started her relationship with rapper Jay-Z, it’s undeniable that together they are one of the world’s hottest power couples. As Baz Luhrmann <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>, “she and Jay Z are the royal couple of culture, and she is the queen bee”.</p><p>Their individual successes have meant that their relationship has remained firmly in the spotlight, although they try to manage the media and give details about their private lives on their own terms.</p><p>Beyoncé and Jay-Z married in 2008 and have three children together but Jay-Z confirmed that he had <a href=# rel=noopener>cheated</a> on Beyoncé after rumors began to circulate. The couple worked on their marriage and appear to be stronger than ever.</p><p>As a musical duo, they have released numerous songs together and <a href=# rel=noopener>dueted</a> on Jay-Z’s track ‘03 Bonnie and Clyde’ in 2002. More recently, they released their collaborative album ‘Everything is Love’, which saw the couple film the lead single <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Apeshit’</a> at the Louvre in Paris.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfsmWZqHqjsdiopZydXZuurrvUrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-beyonce-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-is-beyonce-famous.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-beyonce-famous.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-is-beyonce-famous.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-beyonce-famous.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-beyonce-famous.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./geometry-spot-roblox-everything-you-need-to-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./geometry-spot-roblox-everything-you-need-to-know.html>Geometry Spot Roblox: Everything You Need To Know About Minecraft, Fortnite, And Other Activities</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ciaras-stunning-mother-jackie-harris-and-grandmother-gladys-stewart-were-the-highlight-in-red-carpet-pictures-from-vh1s-dear-mama-event-as-fans-speculate-that-russell-wilsons-wife-might-b-279509.html>Ciaras Stunning Mother, Jackie Harris, And Grandmother Gladys Stewart Were The Highlight In Red C</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ciaras-stunning-mother-jackie-harris-and-grandmother-gladys-stewart-were-the-highlight-in-red-carpet-pictures-from-vh1s-dear-mama-event-as-fans-speculate-that-russell-wilsons-wife-might-b-279509.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

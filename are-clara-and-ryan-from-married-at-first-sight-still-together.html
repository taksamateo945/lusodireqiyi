The end of the marriage was abrupt, Clara revealed. <b>Ryan broke up with her after they’d been out shopping for a house</b>, she said, adding that he said he could no longer trust her because of some candid comments she made about their lack of a sex life on the show.</p><p>What is Ryan from married at first sight Instagram?

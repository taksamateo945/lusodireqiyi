Throughout his career with the Philadelphia Eagles, he has proven to be a versatile and dominant force on the offensive line. Kelce’s athleticism and quickness, combined with his intelligence and strong technique, have made him a leader on the field. He has been a key player in the Eagles’ offensive success, helping them win a Super Bowl in the 2017 season, making him a Super Bowl champion.</p><p>Kelce’s success in the NFL is even more impressive, given his humble beginnings. He was not highly recruited coming out of high school and was only selected in the 6th round of the NFL Draft. However, he worked hard and developed into one of the best centers in the league. He was named to his first Pro Bowl in 2014 and has since been selected to the Pro Bowl every year from 2016 to 2021, making him a six-time Pro Bowl selection.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/jason-kel.jpg><p>Kelce’s performance on the field earned him a 6-year, $37.5 million contract extension in 2014, solidifying his position as a key player for the Eagles. Kelce’s versatility and success on the field make him one of the most respected players in the NFL. He has become a fan favorite in Philadelphia, known for his tough and relentless play, as well as his passionate speeches and colorful personality.</p><p>It is widely believed that Jason Kelce’s impact on the Eagles organization and the NFL as a whole will be felt for years to come, and he will go down as one of the greatest centers in NFL history.</p><h2><strong>Travis Kelce is a Tight End for the Kansas City Chiefs</strong></h2><p>As we have already explained, Travis Kelce is a tight end playing for the Kansas City Chiefs in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft and has since become one of the most accomplished tight ends in the league. Just like his brother, Travis is also a Super Bowl champion, having won Super Bowl LIV with the Chiefs over the San Francisco 49ers and Super LVII with the Chiefs over his brother’s team, the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Travis Kelce played college football at the University of Cincinnati and is considered one of the greatest tight ends of all time. His impressive achievements include 8 Pro Bowl selections, four first-team All-Pro selections, and being named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team. Kelce also holds multiple NFL records for tight ends, including the most consecutive and overall seasons with 1,000 yards receiving, the most receiving yards in a single season by a tight end, and becoming the fastest tight end to reach 10,000 career receiving yards.</p><p>In 2020, Travis Kelce set the record for the most receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,416 yards despite playing in only 15 games. He briefly held the single-season record in 2018 before it was broken later that same day. Travis Kelce’s consistent performance and record-breaking achievements have made him one of the most dominant and revered tight ends in the NFL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/travis-kel.jpg><h2><strong>Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce are the First Brothers to Play in the Super Bowl</strong></h2><p>The Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, have made history in the NFL in several ways. The brothers made history by being the first set of siblings to each play in and win the Super Bowl in the NFL, as both of them are Super Bowl champions. But this is not all; Jason and Travis are the first brothers to play against each other in Super Bowl history following their appearance in Super Bowl LVII, which took place on 13 February 2023.</p><p>This feat is incredible as it has never happened before in the history of the NFL. This unique feat highlights their talent and dedication to the sport, as well as the support and influence of their family. In addition to this great Super Bowl feat they have achieved, the two brothers have also made history with their individual accomplishments for their different teams.</p><p>Recall that Jason Kelce, a center for the Philadelphia Eagles, won Super Bowl LII and is a five-time first-team All-Pro. Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, won Super Bowl LIV and LVII and is a four-time All-Pro. Both are considered future Hall of Famers. Without a doubt, individually, the brothers have done incredible things for themselves careerwise.</p><p>Jason is known for his speed, tacticity, and versatility on the field. He has been an integral part of the Eagles’ success, working hard to help steer the team to win their first Super Bowl championship in 2018. His emotional speeches and memorable celebrations have made him a fan favorite and a leader in the locker room.</p><p>Travis Kelce is considered one of the best players in the league. He has been named to the Pro Bowl five times and the All-Pro team three times, and his impressive performance on the field has been instrumental in leading the Chiefs to multiple Super Bowl appearances. In 2020 and 2023, he helped the Chiefs win Super Bowl LIV and Super Bowl LVII, respectively, thus adding impressive achievements to his already impressive resume.</p><p>So, the Kelce brothers have proven to be two of the most talented and dynamic players in the NFL, and their success in the Super Bowl has made them a force to be reckoned with. Their ability to excel on the biggest stage of the NFL has set them apart and made them a standout duo in Super Bowl history. The Kelce brothers are not only making history, but they are also inspiring future generations of football players and fans alike. Their impact on the Super Bowl and the NFL will be remembered for years to come.</p><h2><b>They Have Faced Each Other on Four Occasions</b></h2><p>In their careers so far, the Kelce brothers have played each other four times. Interestingly, Travis and his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, emerged victorious in each game. But, despite the competition on the field, both brothers have expressed that they are still rooting for each other.</p><p>Jason has stated that “I feel like you can’t help but do that. I’m might not be rooting for the Chiefs, but I’m always rooting for Trav.” Travis has also expressed gratitude towards his older brother, saying, “I wouldn’t be here without my brother, his competitiveness, his leadership, there’s no way I’d be here without him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/kelce.jpg><p>The Kelce brothers grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, where their mother, Donna, raised them. Donna has said that both of her sons were active in multiple sports, playing football, basketball, lacrosse, hockey, and even wrestling. She believes that their diverse athletic experiences have contributed to their well-roundedness and success in football. Keeping her two sons fed was a challenge, as they were constantly hungry and ate everything in sight.</p><h2><strong>The Kelce Brothers Clashed in SuperBowl LVII</strong></h2><p>The two brothers, Jason Kelche and Travis Kelce, met in one of the ultimate games of their careers: the Super Bowl LVII, which was held on 13 February 2023. This game was a battle between the two brothers, as Jason Kelce played for the Philadelphia Eagles while Travis Kelce represented the Kansas City Chiefs. This was such a big deal because, without a doubt, the Super Bowl is one of the most highly anticipated games of the NFL season.</p><p>Both the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs had a rich history of success in the league and had a strong roster of talented players, including Jason and Travis. The Eagles were known for their strong defense and efficient offensive strategy, while the Chiefs had a high-powered offense led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes. The game was touted to be a true test of each team’s strengths and a battle to see which team would come out on top as the Super Bowl champion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/kelce1.jpg><h2><b>Experts Predicted That Travis and the Chiefs Will Win, and They Did</b></h2><p>The Super Bowl is considered the most wagered-on sporting event, attracting a large amount of betting attention each year. The 2023 matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles was no exception. The odds on the money line for this game had the Philadelphia Eagles and Jason Kelce as the slight favorite, with odds of -125, while Kansas City and Travis Kelce were a +105 underdog.</p><p>However, experts predicted that the Chiefs will win the game, especially considering their experienced roster, which is led by star quarterback <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Patrick Mahomes</a> and a veteran team that has been on this stage multiple times in recent seasons. On the other hand, the Eagles were said to be less experienced and thought not to have faced any tough playoff competition.</p><p>Both teams had a history in the Super Bowl, with the Chiefs having played in four Super Bowls, half of which came since Patrick Mahomes became the starting quarterback of the franchise. They won Super Bowl 54 but lost Super Bowl 55 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Meanwhile, the Eagles had played in three Super Bowls, only one of which has come since the end of the 2004 season. They won Super Bowl 52 but lost Super Bowl 15 and 39.</p><p>Super Bowl LVII marked the first appearance for Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni, while Andy Reid, who was head coach when the Eagles lost Super Bowl 39, had a 1-1 lifetime record in the big game. The close odds on the money line and the experienced rosters of both teams made Super Bowl LVII a highly anticipated one, with plenty of betting interest from fans and experts alike.</p><p>In the end, the experts proved they were experts and more knowledgeable than the betting fans as Travis and the Chiefs defeated Jason and the Eagles to win Super Bowl LVII.</p><h2><strong>How Their Parents Reacted</strong></h2><p>As can be expected, Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce’s parents were very excited in the lead-up to Super Bowl LVII as they would get to see their two sons battle each other on the field and make history. Many media organizations interviewed them to see who they would be supporting, and it turned out that they were not going to support one son against the other.</p><p>Their mother, Donna, wore a <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;split jersey</a> to represent both sons and enjoyed the game. Their father, Ed, was similarly neutral and threw his support behind both his boys. When he was asked which of his sons he would talk to first after the game, Ed said he would <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">first talk to whoever loses</a> before reaching out to the victor.</p><p>So, no matter who won the game, THEY, Donna and Ed, were already winners as one of their sons must emerge champion. It was a win-win situation for them.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>How is Jason Kelce Related to Travis Kelce?</strong></h4><p>Jason Kelce is the older brother of Travis Kelce.

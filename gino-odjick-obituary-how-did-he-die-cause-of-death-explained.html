<time>15 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Gino Odjick’s Death</strong> made Vancouver his home, and the city’s hockey fans welcomed him as one of the city’s most adored players. Wayne Gino Odjick was a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who played from 1990 to 2002 with the Vancouver Canucks, New York Islanders, Philadelphia Flyers, and Montreal Canadiens.</p><p>He started his hockey career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Victoriaville Tigres and the Laval Titan. The Vancouver Canucks selected him in the sixth round of the NHL Entry Draft in 1989. Odjick made his NHL debut with the Canucks in 1990-91, quickly distinguishing himself as a tough player known for his toughness and willingness to drop the gloves.</p><h2>Gino Odjick Obituary: Did the Ice Hockey Left Winger Die From AL Amyloidosis?</h2><p><strong>Gino Odjick</strong>, a former Vancouver Canucks left winger, died on Sunday, according to the team. He was 52. When Odjick was diagnosed with AL Amyloidosis seven years ago, Canucks fans came to his help, congregating at the Vancouver hospital where he was receiving treatment. It illustrated the strong bond that fans have with one of their favorite Canucks of all time. The condition affects diverse organs in different persons, but the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, or gastrointestinal system are the most typically affected.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gino-Odjick-1.jpg alt="Gino Odjick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite doctors giving him just weeks to live in 2015, Odjick battled back. As part of the club’s 50th anniversary celebrations, Odjick skated onto Rogers Arena ice in full gear before the start of the 2019-20 season. His appearance drove the House to its knees once again, as fans yelled, “Gino! Gino! Gino!”&nbsp;He holds the most penalty minutes in Canucks history, having played 444 games for the franchise.&nbsp;Odjick, who is on the Canucks Ring of Honour, moved to Vancouver after his playing career ended. On game days, he was often seen throughout town and in the arena, still dressed in Canucks gear and cheering for the team.</p><h2>Meet Gino Odjick Wife: Jolene Odjick</h2><p><strong>Jolene Odjick</strong> is well-known for being the wife of Gino, a former ice hockey player. Jolene has always been there, and she is a very caring and compassionate wife. They are the parents of two children. Bure Odjick and Tobias Commanda-Odjick are their children’s names.&nbsp;Jolene and Gino met when he was playing for the Vancouver Canucks in the early 1990s. They met, fell in love, and eventually married. They have been happily married for many years and have formed a strong and loving bond.</p><p>Jolene has been a constant source of motivation for Gino throughout his hockey career and even after he retired. She was usually at his side while he was in the NHL. Gino gives the appearance of being very careful with his own life since he knows nothing about their interaction with the general public.&nbsp;Jolene is also interested in volunteering and charity causes. She is an active member of the First Nations community who works hard to raise awareness about issues that are important to her people.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gino-Odjick-2.jpg alt="Gino Odjick" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Gino Odjick’s Parents Whereabouts &&nbsp; Family Details</h2><p>His parents were Joe and Marie-Antoinette. He is survived by eight children and five sisters.&nbsp;Odjick grew raised in Kitigan Zibi, a small reserve in Maniwaki, Quebec, about three hours north of Ottawa. His parents took in foster children and had other individuals stay with them on a regular basis. The House was open to everyone. Gino’s father was a passionate hockey fan who brought him to games and practices on a regular basis. He had a huge influence on Gino’s hockey enthusiasm and played a significant role in his decision to pursue a hockey career.</p><p>At the time, Bob Hartley, who was coaching a nearby Junior A team, saw Odjick playing in a local league and offered him to join his club. The Laval Titan of Quebec’s major-junior Company was the next to take him.&nbsp;Gino’s mother was also crucial since she was always supportive of his hockey career. She was a regular at his games and practices, always there to show her love and support. Gino often expressed his appreciation for his mother’s assistance and how much it meant to him.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieoqafYryltsicomankp7Btq3RsmShp6disaqwjKGcZpyZmnqkrdSsnGanlmKxpq3ToWSesKChrqq6xJ1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgino-odjick-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgino-odjick-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgino-odjick-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgino-odjick-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgino-odjick-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgino-odjick-obituary-how-did-he-die-cause-of-death-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ms-pacman-alejandra-video-alejandra-ico-chub-murder.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ms-pacman-alejandra-video-alejandra-ico-chub-murder.html>Ms Pacman Alejandra Video: Alejandra Ico Chub Murder</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./makes-good-on-as-a-debt-2-wds-html.html>Makes good on as a debt: 2 wds.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./makes-good-on-as-a-debt-2-wds-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
